## Intorduction: using deep learning to learn kinetics of phase transitions

The phase transition is one of the most important concept in materials science. Phenomenologically, we may describe the kinetics of phase transitions with the phase field model in the framework of Ginzburg-Landau theory. The phase-field equation (Allen-Cahn) dictates that the temporal evolution of the phase field can be described by the partial-differential equation below,

<a href="https://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\frac{\partial&space;\phi}{\partial&space;t}&space;=&space;\kappa&space;\Delta&space;\phi&space;&plus;&space;\mu(\phi)" target="_blank"><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\frac{\partial&space;\phi}{\partial&space;t}&space;=&space;\kappa&space;\Delta&space;\phi&space;&plus;&space;\mu(\phi)" title="\frac{\partial \phi}{\partial t} = \kappa \Delta \phi + \mu(\phi)" /></a>.

The left-hand side is the temporal derivative of the phase field. The first term on the right-hand side is the diffusive term containing the Laplace operator, and the second term is the chemical potential as a function of phase field.
